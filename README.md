# Personal DEV Enviroment Dotfiles

This is a collection of my current(and ongoing) development enviroment.
Im using GNU\Stow for symlink management and symlink them to the $HOME dir.
You can use stow or write your own simple sh to create and deploy these dotfiles to your current setup.

## Enviroment details

- OS: Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm) x86_64
 - Kernel: 6.11.4-arch2-1
 - Editor : Emacs 29
 - Terminal: Alacritty
 - Shell: ZSH + OMZ
 - Display Manager: X11
 - Window Manager: i3

very minimalistic and bloat-free setup for especially develop C/C++/ASM programs but you can extend my Emacs setup for many programming languages.

Im not using any lsp server to complete/intelisese because im found it silly and heavily bloated to have an internet connection to use basic intelisense, instead im using yasnippet and preconfigured snippets for auto complation. So, you have to download and place your snippets in .emacs.d folder. You can find many of them on online.

## The Ideology

The ideology of this setup is keeping my workflow minimalistic yet powerfull. And i think i achieve this :)
